## Descripion
  A component that should be a replic of the eclipse IDE back/forward feature. We see this feature has a navigation option because the developer has the oportunity to check the last class (for example) consulted. Imagine this: you jumped 20 classes of your project, and you want to know the previous or the previous class you acessed of your current one.
  
  Also, the plugin have a graphic mode that shows the navigation in boxes.

## Extension points

#### - Event

This extension point has an interface that defines the methods that could be implemented
in order to change the way that back and forward navigation works. All this works has an event, and should affect the navigation historic it self
